# CHANGELOG

## [v5.1.0](https://github.com/softspring/cms-sylius-bundle/releases/tag/v5.1.0)

### Upgrading

There are too many changes in this version, so you must check your code to adapt it to the new version.

As we noticed in README, this bundle is still under development, so it has changed a lot since the last version.

We are not going to provide a full changelog.
